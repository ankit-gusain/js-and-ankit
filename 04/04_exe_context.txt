JS
Single-threaded language, means that it has only one execution thread, 
and code is executed sequentially, one operation at a time.


In JavaScript, 
an "execution context" is a concept that refers to the environment in which a piece of code 
is executed. It includes information about the variables and functions that are currently 
in scope, as well as the value of the "this" keyword.
